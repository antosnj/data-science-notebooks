# Data Science Projects
A repository with some of the personal data science projects I have done so far, which I keep updated at [my Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/samaxtech). Each project folder contains the dataset **(whose path needs to be updated with your working directory when reading the data in)** and IPython notebook, which includes a detailed documentation of the project.

If you find any of them useful or have any questions feel free to reach out! :)
